Assembling the shield isn't too complicated but it does require some soldering.  All the SMT devices are resoldered on the board.

General principles when soldering, start from lowest and work your way up to highest.

### Step 1

Layout all the pieces and double check you have everything you need.

### Step 2

Position the two audio jacks and solder them in place.  When working on multi-pin components I like I solder one pin first to hold it in place while I check to make sure it is aligned correctly and flush with the board.  If you solder all the pins then discover it's crooked or not flush, it's more difficult to correct the problem.

### Step 3

Position the shield header that will connect the shield to the raspberry pi.
